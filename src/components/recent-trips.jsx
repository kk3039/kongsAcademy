                                    underestimated by Kong, while Daniel and
                                    Raven were the first time backpacking in the
                                    mountain. The view was absolute fantastic,

                                    is no waste disposal of any kind. The
                                    morning we got up at 4 o'clock to obtain the
                                    backcountry permit, the ranger station
                                    provided each of us a disposal bag,

                                    she would do before Kong could stop her -
                                    asking for two bags! She added, "I probably
                                    need a lot..." As later happened, it turned
                                    out that Kong needed two bags because of the

                                    week of skiing for him overall. However,

                                    who learn how to ski even before they know

                                    Snowbird UT, we didn't feel like leaving the
                                    mountain. People were gradually skiing back
                                    to the base area and found out we were still
                                    waiting for others to come back, they would

                                    until 20 mins after the lift literally
                                    stopped and we saw a few people running down
                                    and enjoying their last run on the empty
                                    slope. They told Kong,{' '}

                                    Half way through the night, we were half

                                    game. All of a sudden, Kong proposed without
                                    any context "how about let's do it again
                                    next year? or how about doing it every
                                    Christmas and New Year as our annual party?"
                                    Everyone was like "yeah sure of course" but
                                    nothing else was talked about. More than
                                    half a year later, Kong formed a Facebook
                                    group and asked if anybody is interested
                                    going skiing again the coming Christmas. It
                                    turned out in 2018 Christmas, we had even
                                    more people than the previous year at

                                    Snowbird the year before could comfortably

                                    ski trip, and instead of skiing one resort,
                                    most of us committed a EPIC pass so we skied
                                    Keystone, A-basin, Vail, and Breckenridge.
                                    We had our first two days at Vail with a lot
                                    of powder, and we particularly liked the
                                    Legendary back bowl. Without the trees and
                                    with a lot of snow, one can just go anywhere
                                    without worrying about which trail to take.

                                    The planning of the trip was done usually
                                    right after the summer, when the prices of
                                    the Airbnb and flights are still reasonable.
                                    The New York crew drove for about 30 hours
                                    to Colorado, Bay area people drove about 20
                                    hours. People from Texas generally fly to
                                    Denver and rent an all-wheel pickup truck
                                    for the mountain weather. Kong and others
                                    usually get to the mountain first and take
                                    care of things that are usually needed for
                                    beginners, e.g., finding the place for
                                    rental, sometimes a group lesson for the
                                    first half-day, and so on. Also after the
                                    skiing, they would usually go for grocery
                                    shopping and prepare the dinner. It's a very
                                    special time in a year that people are not
                                    so addicted to their laptops and phones
                                    (some still do) and they do something
                                    together in the house in the evening.
