            <h2>Kong</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-0"> Kong is an <strong> experimental nuclear and particle physicist</strong>, working on experiments using high energy particle colliders. Kong is interested in not only what the origin of the universe is, but also the detail mechanism of how protons and neutrons bound together and form atom, and how quarks and gluons form nucleon. Other than being a physicist, he has founded the <strong> Kong's Academy</strong> to bring his friends together and aim to inspire people to connect to each other based on shared experience. Nevertheless he likes to share stories and adventures with friends. </p>

            <p class="lead mb-0"> Estella goes to Princeton University for a Ph.D in <strong>Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</strong>, specializing in fluid mechanics. She is an expert for using bubbles to separate "particles" (very different meaning of particle comparing to Kong's particle!) in different sizes, ranging from a few microns to hundreds of microns. Skiing for Estella is like a practice of applying fluid mechanics on every turn!

She focuses on structural analysis, mostly bridge health monitoring and related methods such as finite element modeling. Also Raven likes to read, go skiing with friends, and go to museums in Manhattan. She learned how to ski a black diamond only in 7 days with zero experience, and she inspired so many people around her to do things that are not in their comfort zones.

He is interested in understanding how the translation of messenger RNAs is controlled during animal development by combining classical biochemistry, genetics, and high-throughput sequencing approaches, using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model. He's been practicing piano for 20 years, and Beethoven is his favorite composer. Yingshi plays a lot of sports too, including skiing, rock climbing, and table tennis. <strong>He is also a sub-3:30 marathon runner!</strong>

                    <p class="text-muted"> Kong and I used to hoop a lot at the Rice gym. Being his teammate is comfortable because he likes to control the pace and is always looking to make the optimal decision, whether passing or scoring. Not surprisingly, skiing with him and others feels similar. I first skied with Kong in 2017 at Snowbird in Utah. Kong and Estella were super helpful and patient in teaching the basics. A lot of encouragement on the slopes and they would throw just the right amount of challenges at you so you can progress. Last Christmas - New Year, we went on a ski trip in Breckenridge and I was able to see my improvement from the previous year. After each day of skiing, we could mark down the toughest slope that we conquered without a fall and it made the trip just a little bit more competitive and fun. Counting the days for the trip this year.</p>

I went on another ski trip with Kong again in 2018 to Colorado. A group of us shared a rental home for a few days as always, where I had the opportunity to meet some new people and bound with old friends. Can't think of any better way of spending my New Years. Looking forward to 2019 ski trip!</p>

I was trying to figure out how to spend all of my newly found free time when Kong offered to teach me how to rock climb. He distilled all of the knowledge he gained over the years in a way that I, a complete beginner, could understand and follow. It didn’t take long for me to climb like a pro. Then, as winter approached, he invited me to go skiing at Snowbird. Once again, he patiently taught me the basics and after three days I was able to make my way down the blue slopes. My job took me to Switzerland for half a year and I was able to catch the ski season. Due to the great instruction from Kong, I was able to enjoy myself in Chamonix, further improving my skills and skiing some of the best the Alps had to offer! Now I look forward each year to our ski trip during Christmas and the delicious food Kong and Estella prepare. But, until then you can find me at the crag!</p>
